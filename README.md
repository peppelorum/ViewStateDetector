A viewstate detector, shows a badge in Google Chrome in the upper right corner when viewstate is detected.

(Viewstates are produced by sites running on MS WebForms, such as Sharepoint, Episerver etc and should never be used.)

You can find the Chrome extension in the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/viewstate-detector/imjmfjlhlmpogimhbcijdnjmkhoojhfo) for installation.
